"VEMS for visual inspection - Digital Asset Management"

VEMS = Vehicle Equipment Measurement Systems

| Abbreviation | Likely meaning                                                                                         | Rationale / notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Verification action                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VIS**      | Visual Inspection subsystem                                                                            | The VEMS “for Visual Inspection” flyer explicitly uses **VIS** and describes a solution that “enables customers to carry out a virtual exam while the train is still in service.” ([Siemens Assets][1])                                                                                                      | This one is solid. Use the product documentation for “VEMS for Visual Inspection (VIS)” for full details.                                 |
| **BPMS**     | Brake-Pad Monitoring System or Braking Performance Monitoring System                                   | Brake/axle/wheel monitoring is common in VEMS suites. “BPMS” could fit “Brake Pad Monitoring System” (or “Brake Performance Monitoring System”). But I could *not* locate a Siemens doc that explicitly expands BPMS in the VEMS context.                                                                    | Check the DMS UI tooltips or configuration pages: hover over “BPMS” to see full label or check system-module lists in the MRX DMS manual. |
| **BPMS-DA**  | Data Analytics extension for BPMS (i.e., Brake Pad Monitoring System – Data Analytics)                 | The “-DA” suffix often stands for “Data Analytics” or “Diagnostic Analytics”. So BPMS-DA might be the analytics/reporting sub-module for the BPMS subsystem.                                                                                                                                                 | Look in the DMS module list for “BPMS-DA” or “BPMS Analytics” and see its description.                                                    |
| **CSMS**     | Condition & Status Monitoring System or Component Status Monitoring System                             | In rail/industrial systems, CSMS – Component Status Monitoring System – is plausible. It may refer to a subsystem that monitors component/asset status (rather than measurement of dimensions). No explicit Siemens doc found.                                                                               | Inspect the system architecture diagram in the MRX docs: find the “CSMS” block and view its label/legend.                                 |
| **WPMX**     | Wheel Profile Monitoring (e)X or Wheel Profile Monitoring & X-ray or Wheel Profile Monitoring eXtended | The prefix “WP” likely = Wheel Profile, which is a standard VEMS measurement domain. The “MX” suffix is less clear — could mean “Monitoring & X-ray” or “Monitoring eXtended” or “Measurement eXtended”. There is mention in VEMS literature of wheel profile measurement. I didn’t find “WPMX” spelled out. | Check the VEMS measurement module list: look for “WPMX” or “Wheel Profile Monitoring – MX module” or ask Siemens contact.                 |
