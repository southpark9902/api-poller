Each parameter set will have differing number of measurements due to differing subsystems",,Closed,,,,,,
Arrays & Nested,"Structure of 'values' array: names and types of elements (timestamp, value, type, quality?)?",Needed to choose columns or JSON cell,,High,"values field will generally hold either a boolean or a number value. While we support arrays and strings for value, no subsystem used in SETL will emit these",,,,,,,,

Can we get a permanent token with no expiry?,Affects caching and refresh logic,"e.g. access_token expires 15m, refresh_token 30d, Never expires",High,"Current PSS requirements that we are beholden to do not allow permenant tokens. The access_token is configured to expire after 5 minutes, I cannot find a refresh_token expiry time, but there is a session idle time of 30minutes",,,,,,,,
Authentication,"Where is the Keycloak instance running (hostname, realm, client) and how to obtain client credentials? (client id / secret)",Needed to request JWTs and configure automated pulls,"e.g. auth.example.com, realm: vems, client_id: southeatern, client_secret: <secret>",High,"The Keycloak instance is hosted on the same PCE as the DMS UI, and can be accessed using the same base url `/auth`.",,,,,,,,
Authentication,"Are there audience/claim requirements in JWTs (scope, roles, issuer)?","If server validates specific claims, need to craft requests accordingly","Require 'aud': 'dms-api', scope: 'dms.read'",High,"You will get your JWT from Keycloak, so this is not something you need to be concerned with.",,,,,,,,

Data Quality,"Are there quality/flag fields in results (e.g. status, confidence) and allowed ranges?",Important for filtering/alerts,,High,"All parameter sets come with a status and a confidence field. Status should be ""OK"" if there is no issue with a measurement.

Error Handling,"Are transient errors retryable, and which HTTP codes indicate retry vs fail if any?","Help to implement robust retry/backoff. Help to implement retry strategy that avoids hammering the API, handles transient failures, respects server signals, and prevents synchronized retry storms.","E.g. retry only on transient errors: 429, 502, 503, 504, timeout/network glitches. Do NOT retry 4xx client errors (400,401,403,404) except 429. if Retry-After header present, wait that long (seconds or HTTP-date). ",High,"Suggested guidelines seem valid.

Pagination,What semantics for limit/offset vs cursor? Are there max limits and defaults?,OpenAPI mentions limit/offset but no defaults/max,,High,"Default offset is 0, and can be set to any value. If offset is > than the number of results available, no results will be returned.
Default limit is 20, with a max value of 500. Offset can be used with limit to fetch results in excess of the 500 max, you can view offset as picking from what point to fetch results from.",,,,,,,,

Search DSL / semantics,How to express nested path names in queries (dot notation vs underscore vs @Definition.k)? The docs reference multiple styles.,Inconsistent examples: '@Definition.component_category' vs 'component_category' vs 'details_threshold_value',,Low,,,,,,,,,
Search DSL / semantics,What is the maximum allowed 'limit' and do larger values impact server performance? Is 500 enforced server-side?,Docs mention default max 500 — confirm hard limit and error codes,,High,500 is enforced. Larger values definitely impact server performance.,,,,,,,,
Search rate/Cost,Does total=true cause an expensive server-side count? Should we avoid total for frequent polling?,"If expensive, we will not set total in normal polls",,Med,,,,,,,,,
Security,"Does the API perform role checks via claim names (e.g., roles in 'realm_access') and which role strings are used?",We must include correct roles or group membership for endpoint access,,Low,,,,,,,,,
SLA for schema fixes,"If we find schema bugs, how quickly will Siemens supply corrected OpenAPI and patched API?",Project timeline and risk mitigation,,High,This will vary depending on the scale of the issue. Will depend also on what change orders are in place.,,,,,,,,
Sorting semantics,Sort fields mention 'max 5 fields' — confirm behaviour for nested fields and stability of sort for pagination.,"To perform deterministic paging, sort must be stable. e.g., '-pass_online_timestamp'",,Med,,,,,,,,,
Streaming & webhooks,"Is there a push alternative (webhooks, message queue, streaming API like SSE or MQTT) for near-real-time notifications?",Polling is inefficient for low-latency use cases,,Low,,,,,,,,,
Support & SLA,Who is the Siemens support contact and SLA for outages/bugs? Any escalation matrix for API defects?,Project management and planning,,High,"Post-handover, this will need to go through Customer Service locally and will be fed to relevant people.",,,,,,,,
Test accounts & permissions,Provide test accounts with dms_user and dms_admin roles and sample tokens so we can validate permissions.,Necessary for role-matrix testing,,High,We will supply user accounts when they come through. Admin will be supplied in the future.,,,,,,,,
Testing & sandbox,"Provide sandbox URL, test data, sample JWTs and test client credentials for integration testing.",We currently have no access — must test in isolation,,Low,,,,,,,,,
Testing data volume,Provide typical payload sizes for /results/timeseries/search responses (bytes and number of elements) for normal and peak loads.,Helps sizing storage and network,,High,"There is not really a typical payload size, this is heavily influenced by the use (eg 100 results will require less than 500)",,,,,,,,
Testing harness,"Do you provide Postman/Newman collections, or sample curl examples for all endpoints including authentication flows?",Speeds our integration testing,,Med,,,,,,,,,
Time format & timezone,"If timezone is not UTC, provide server timezone or ISO timestamp formats and DST behavior.",,,Low,,,,,,,,,
TLS & ciphers,What TLS minimum version/cipher requirements are enforced? Do we need to support TLS1.3 only?,Cert and client compatibility planning,,Med,Answered previously,,,,,,,,
User roles & tenants,Are roles tenant-specific (per site) or global? Should service tokens be scoped per-site?,Affects token scoping and access control,,Low,Answered previously,,,,,,,,
Webhook security,"If webhooks exist, what signing/verification method is used (HMAC, JWT)?",Ensure webhook source authenticity,,Low,,,,,,,,,
